########## kNN for Caravan Data - MY CODE ENDS HERE ##########

########## kNN using iris dataset ##########
# We are going to look at a simple dataset for 3 different species of Iris plant

# The blelow command loads the data into memory. When the data is loaded it is there in "Values"
# area of environment as <Promise>
data(iris)
# To move the loadedd iris data into the "Data" area of the environment so that we can see it
iris

# Step 1 for machine learning is to load the data into R and assign column names using names() command.
# In order to use the names() we must know what each column of the data represents. Hence an initial 
# understanding of the data you are using is a must. 

# Step 2 - Profound understanding of the data. This includes understanding the structure of data, data
# type of each column

# Looking at the first few rows of the dataset can give some clarity on how the data is stored and
# various values possible for a column
head(iris)

# Understanding the structure of data is very important before we begin to create any model.
str(iris)
# Using the str() command we come to know that all the columns except for Species are numeric. Species
# is a factor with 3 levels implies that Species is a ctegorical variable where as all other variables 
# are continuous variables. Many R machine learning classifiers require that the target feature is coded
# as factor. That's why it is important to find out the structure of dataset - to help us determine
# the target feature - one for which the prediction is based. In this excercise we are going to predict
# Species of Iris plant based on input value of other numeric field.

# Understanding the distribution of data 
summary(iris)
summary(iris[c("Petal.Width", "Sepal.Width")]) # for specific columns
# summary() command gives the details of minimum, maximum, median, mean, 1st quarter, 3rd quarter for
# numeric fields and number of observations for each level of factor variables. It is important to have 
# equally distributed data for each level of factor data. If there are say 500 rows for species one, 
# 50 rows for each of species 2 & 3 then there is a possibiltiy of skewed result for kNN algorithm. It
# important that the data is distributed equally with respect to target feature.

table(iris$Species)
round(prop.table(table(iris$Species)) * 100, digits = 1)
# For prop.table see - http://www.statmethods.net/stats/frequencies.html

# Step 3 - Create plots on the data set to understand the corellation of various columns with each 
# other. Scatter plots help in understanding how various variables are corelated with each other. 
# There are 2 ways to create scatter plots ggvis and ggplot2. ggplot2 is better as we can overlay 
# multiple layers on top of each other.
library(ggvis)
iris %>% ggvis(~Sepal.Length, ~Sepal.Width, fill = ~Species) %>% layer_points()
# This gives the relation between Sepal Length and Width
iris %>% ggvis(~Petal.Length, ~Petal.Width, fill = ~Species) %>% layer_points()
# This gives the relation between Petal Length and Width

# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is very important to have a basic understanding of the dataset so that we can 
# take a decision on finding corelation between which columns. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# Step 4 - Normalize the data if required. In the summary() you will see the min and max of a variable.
# All the variables in the dataset must lie within a specific limit of each other. If one of the 
# variables X has value from 1 to 100 and other variable Y has a range of 1 to 1000, then variable Y's
# influence on distance calculation will overpower X's influence. To overcome this we need to normalize
# the dataset so that the distance between variables with larger range will not be overemphasised.
# Normalization must be done only for numeric columns. Normalizing factor column will result in error.
# 'min' not meaningful for factors
normalize <- function(x) {
  return(((x - min(x))/(max(x) - min(x))))
}
normalizedIris <- as.data.frame(lapply(iris[1:4], normalize))
# normalizedIris will have only those columns that are mentioned in the lapply() function (numeric columns). 
# Add the species column
normalizedIris$Species <- iris$Species

# Step 6 - Creating Training and Test sets. The input dataset should be divided into two parts. One for
# training and another for testing the model. Usually 2/3rd of the dataset is used for training and 1/3rd of
# dataset is used for testing the model. The idea behind dividing the input dataset into 2 parts is once the 
# model is created - we will input the values from test dataset into the model and see if we get the same 
# result as the already available result of the test dataset. The percent of mismatch will tell us about the 
# accuracy of our model. Again the knowledge of dataset is important to divide the input dataset to training 
# test dataset. All the possible values of target variable must be represented equally in the training dataset.

# Dividing the dataset. We want to divide the iris dataset into 2 parts - one with 2/3rd of rows and another
# with 1/3rd of rows. We create a new variable called indicator and randomly assign 1 or 2 for each row of iris
# dataset. We will really update the iris dataset and add another column. The random numbers are generated 
# by sample() function. Before we generate the random sequence of 1s and 2s through sample() we set a seed.
# This is a number of R's random number generator. The major advantage of setting a seed is that you can get 
# the same sequence of random numbers whenever you supply the same seed in the random number generator.
set.seed(2711)
ind <- sample(2, nrow(iris), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.67, 0.33))
# sample() generates a sequence of numbers from 1:x - x being the first argument. It will generate a sequence 
# of n number - n being the second argument. replace = TRUE implies that 1:x numbers may repeat in the 
# sequence. prob argument defines the probability of occurance of each number. The first number will occur
# 67% times and other will occur 33% times. 2 possible errors - 
# 1. x < n and replace = FALSE implies that we want to generate a sequence of, say, 1 & 2, say 150 times and
# do not want to replace the numbers. So the 1:x will each be used once and still there will be more spots to 
# fill. This results in error - cannot take a sample larger than the population when 'replace = FALSE'
# 2. The number of elements in probability vector is less than x. So we want to generate a sequence of say of
# 1s, 2s and 3s and have specified probability of occurance for only 2 numbers. This results in error - 
# incorrect number of probabilities

# Now that we have generated a sequence of 1s and 2s 150 times with probability of 67 & 33 % we divide the 
# dataset into 2 parts. Since iris dataset is already normalized we use the same dataset otherwise use the 
# normalized dataset created above.

iris.training <- iris[ind == 1, 1:4]
iris.test <- iris[ind == 2, 1:4]
iris.trainLabels <- iris[ind == 1, 5]
iris.testLabels <- iris[ind == 2, 5]
# In the training and test datsets we do not include the target variable. But the target variable is an input 
# to kNN algorithm so we create a vector separately.

# Step 7 - Build classifier
# knn() function in R uses Euclidean distance measure to find out k nearest neignbours. The value of K is
# provided by programmer.  In case of classification, the data point with the highest score wins the battle
# and the unknown instance receives the label of that winning data point. If there is an equal amount of
# winners, the classification happens randomly. k parameter is often odd to avoid ties in the voting scores.  
# Load class library that has knn function
library(class)
iris_pred <- knn(train = iris.training, test = iris.test, cl = iris.trainLabels, k=7)
# iris_pred will have the lables of target variable for every row of the test dataset. train is training 
# dataset. test is test dataset. cl is the true classification of target variable in train dataset. This is why
# we created a separate vector iris.trainLables. k is the number of nearest neighbours to be considered.

# Step 8 - Evaluating Model
# At this point we have 2 vectors for the lables of target variable related to test dataset. 
# 1. iris.testLables which has the actual data of target variable of test dataset
# 2. iris_pred which has the prediction of target variable of test dataset. 
# In order to find out the accuracy of our model we need to compare above two vectors. 
# Load gmodels library which has CrossTable function.
library(gmodels)
CrossTable(x = iris.testLabels, y = iris_pred, prop.chisq=FALSE)
# the last argument prop.chisq indicates whether or not the chi-square contribution of each cell is included. 
# The chi-square statistic is the sum of the contributions from each of the individual cells and is used to 
# decide whether the difference between the observed and the expected values is significant.
# Looking at the output we can determine the success ratio of our model. values of k can be changed to improve
# the model and come to a correct model. 
# Below is the output for k = 3
