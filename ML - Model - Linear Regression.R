# We start with a scatter plot for every point in the dataset. How does a linear model works?
# Linear model is nothing but a straight line that best fits the points. For this we calculate 
# the distance of each point to the assumed line that best fits the points in data frame. This 
# distance is called residual. We square the residual and take sum of all square residuals. 
# The line that best fits the points is the one with smallest sum of square residual distances
# This is done directly in R using lm() function

################### How to predict using Linear Regression Model ################### 
# Step 1 - Create the model
sheight = father.son$sheight
fheight = father.son$fheight
lm_father_son_height = lm(sheight~fheight)
# lm_father_son_height = lm(father.son$sheight~father.son$fheight)
# Step 2 - Store Slope and coeffiect of the liner model
intercept_linear_model = coef(lm_father_son_height)[1]
slope_linear_model = coef(lm_father_son_height)[2]
# Step 3 - Predict the new value of Y based on the data
# Method 1
new_father_height = 71.2
fheight = 71.2
new_son_height = slope_linear_model * new_father_height + intercept_linear_model
new_son_height
intercept_linear_model
slope_linear_model
# Method 2 
new_son_height2 = predict(lm_father_son_height, data.frame(fheight))
new_son_height2

# Why sheight = father.son$sheight & fheight = father.son$fheight are added
# The model is created with father.son$sheight~father.son$fheight and predicted using predict
# method we get a warning 
# Warning message:
#  'newdata' had 1 row but variables found have 1078 rows
# and the model returns 1078 rows. This is because the model is created with 
# father.son$fheight and prediction is done with fheight. This creates a conflict within the 
# predict method.
